# UnclassedPenguin Game of Life in Go

## Reasoning

I have been practicing my go lately, and so I decided to make [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  

Thanks to [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg) for the complicated (at least for me) math to do the wrap around world.  


## To-Do:

- Handle panic if while running terminal size changes and it tries to go out of range of the array.
- Maybe add a history of what the starting array was, so you can repeat it?
- Add ability to start with a custom array instead of random...So you can draw interesting patterns and see them working.
